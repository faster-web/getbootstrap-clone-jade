	h2#download-cdn Bootstrap CDN
	p
		| The folks over at 
		a(href='https://www.maxcdn.com/') MaxCDN
		|  graciously provide CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. Just use these 
		a(href='https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/') Bootstrap CDN
		|  links.
	| {% highlight html %}
	// Latest compiled and minified CSS
	link(rel='stylesheet', href='{{ site.cdn.css }}')
	// Optional theme
	link(rel='stylesheet', href='{{ site.cdn.css_theme }}')
	// Latest compiled and minified JavaScript
	script(src='{{ site.cdn.js }}')

	h2#download-bower Install with Bower
	p
		| You can also install and manage Bootstrap's Less, CSS, JavaScript, and fonts using 
		a(href='http://bower.io') Bower
		| :
	| 	{% highlight bash %}$ bower install bootstrap{% endhighlight %}
	h2#download-npm Install with npm
	p
		| You can also install Bootstrap using 
		a(href='https://www.npmjs.com') npm
		| :
	| 	{% highlight bash %}$ npm install bootstrap{% endhighlight %}
	p
		code require('bootstrap')
		|  will load all of Bootstrap's jQuery plugins onto the jQuery object. The 
		code bootstrap
		|  module itself does not export anything. You can manually load Bootstrap's jQuery plugins individually by loading the 
		code /js/*.js
		|  files under the package's top-level directory.
	p
		| Bootstrap's 
		code package.json
		|  contains some additional metadata under the following keys:
	ul
		li
			code less
			|  - path to Bootstrap's main 
			a(href='http://lesscss.org') Less
			|  source file
		li
			code style
			|  - path to Bootstrap's non-minified CSS that's been precompiled using the default settings (no customization)
	h2#download-composer Install with Composer
	p
		| You can also install and manage Bootstrap's Less, CSS, JavaScript, and fonts using 
		a(href='https://getcomposer.org') Composer
		| :
	| 	{% highlight bash %}$ composer require twbs/bootstrap{% endhighlight %}
	h2#download-autoprefixer Autoprefixer required for Less/Sass
	p
		| Bootstrap uses 
		a(href='https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer') Autoprefixer
		|  to deal with 
		a(href='http://webdesign.about.com/od/css/a/css-vendor-prefixes.htm') CSS vendor prefixes
		| . If you're compiling Bootstrap from its Less/Sass source and not using our Gruntfile, you'll need to integrate Autoprefixer into your build process yourself. If you're using precompiled Bootstrap or using our Gruntfile, you don't need to worry about this because Autoprefixer is already integrated into our Gruntfile.
