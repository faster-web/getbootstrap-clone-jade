		| Bootstrap uses 
		a(href='http://gruntjs.com') Grunt
		|  for its build system, with convenient methods for working with the framework. It's how we compile our code, run tests, and more.
	h2#grunt-installing Installing Grunt
	p
		| To install Grunt, you must 
		strong
			| first 
			a(href='https://nodejs.org/download/') download and install node.js
		|  (which includes npm). npm stands for 
		a(href='https://www.npmjs.com/') node packaged modules
		|  and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.
	| 	Then, from the command line:
	ol
		li
			| Install 
			code grunt-cli
			|  globally with 
			code npm install -g grunt-cli
			| .
		li
			| Navigate to the root 
			code /bootstrap/
			|  directory, then run 
			code npm install
			| . npm will look at the 
			a(href='https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/package.json')
				code package.json
			|  file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.
	p
		| When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.
	h2#grunt-commands Available Grunt commands
	h3
		code grunt dist
		|  (Just compile CSS and JavaScript)
	p
		| Regenerates the 
		code /dist/
		|  directory with compiled and minified CSS and JavaScript files. As a Bootstrap user, this is normally the command you want.
	h3
		code grunt watch
		|  (Watch)
	p
		| Watches the Less source files and automatically recompiles them to CSS whenever you save a change.
	h3
		code grunt test
		|  (Run tests)
	p
		| Runs 
		a(href='http://jshint.com') JSHint
		|  and runs the 
		a(href='http://qunitjs.com') QUnit
		|  tests headlessly in 
		a(href='http://phantomjs.org') PhantomJS
		| .
	h3
		code grunt docs
		|  (Build & test the docs assets)
	p
		| Builds and tests CSS, JavaScript, and other assets which are used when running the documentation locally via 
		code jekyll serve
		| .
	h3
		code grunt
		|  (Build absolutely everything and run tests)
	p
		| Compiles and minifies CSS and JavaScript, builds the documentation website, runs the HTML5 validator against the docs, regenerates the Customizer assets, and more. Requires 
		a(href='http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/') Jekyll
		| . Usually only necessary if you're hacking on Bootstrap itself.
	h2#grunt-troubleshooting Troubleshooting
	p
		| Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running Grunt commands, first delete the 
		code /node_modules/
		|  directory generated by npm. Then, rerun 
		code npm install
		| .
