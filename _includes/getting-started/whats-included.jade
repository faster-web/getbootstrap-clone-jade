		| This is the most basic form of Bootstrap: precompiled files for quick drop-in usage in nearly any web project. We provide compiled CSS and JS (
		code bootstrap.*
		| ), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (
		code bootstrap.min.*
		| ). CSS 
		a(href='https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors') source maps
		|  (
		code bootstrap.*.map
		| ) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools. Fonts from Glyphicons are included, as is the optional Bootstrap theme.
	h2#whats-included-source Bootstrap source code
	p
		| The Bootstrap source code download includes the precompiled CSS, JavaScript, and font assets, along with source Less, JavaScript, and documentation. More specifically, it includes the following and more:
	| {% highlight bash %}
	| bootstrap/
	| ├── less/
	| ├── js/
	| ├── fonts/
	| ├── dist/
	| │   ├── css/
	| │   ├── js/
	| │   └── fonts/
	| └── docs/
	| 		└── examples/
	| {% endhighlight %}
	p
		| The 
		code less/
		| , 
		code js/
		| , and 
		code fonts/
		|  are the source code for our CSS, JS, and icon fonts (respectively). The 
		code dist/
		|  folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. The 
		code docs/
		|  folder includes the source code for our documentation, and 
		code examples/
		|  of Bootstrap usage. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.
